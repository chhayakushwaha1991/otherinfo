Datadog is a monitoring and analytics tool for information technology (IT) and DevOps teams that can be used to determine performance metrics as well as 
event monitoring for infrastructure and cloud services. The software can monitor services such as servers, databases and tools.
Datadog monitoring software is available for deployment on premises or as a software as a service (SaaS). Datadog supports Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems.
Support for cloud service providers includes AWS, Microsoft Azure, Red Hat OpenShift and Google Cloud Platform.
Datadog uses a Go-based agent and its backend is made from Apache Cassandra, PostgreSQL and Kafka. A Rest application program interface (API) is used to 
allow Datadog to integrate with numerous services, tools, and programming languages. Integrations such as Kubernetes, Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Ubuntu and Bitbucket.
The user interface includes customizable dashboards that can show graphs composed of multiple data sources in real-time. Datadog can also send users 
notifications of performance issues on any set metric, such as compute rates. Users are notified through means such as email, Slack or PagerDuty.
